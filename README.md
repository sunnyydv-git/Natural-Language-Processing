**📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Journey**

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository, where I document my learning, experiments, and hands-on projects. This repository covers everything from text preprocessing and feature extraction to deep learning-based NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and text generation using NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face, and PyTorch.

**📌 About This Repository**

This repository serves as a structured guide to NLP, exploring both traditional techniques (TF-IDF, word embeddings) and advanced deep learning models (Transformers, BERT, GPT, LLaMA). I’ll be experimenting with different NLP pipelines, fine-tuning models, and optimizing performance while sharing insights along the way.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

Python, NLTK, spaCy 

TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, GPT, T5, LLaMA)

Text Processing & Tokenization
